# Task 2.2

I decided to use a dictionary data structure to hold my "recipe_1" data because it already contains keys and values so a dictionary makes the most sense. I can also easily modify my dictionary to edit values or keys as well as add or remove values or keys. On top of that I will be easily able to list values into separate lists.

I also decided to use a list data structure to hold "all_recipes" because the structure needed to be sequential but also could be modified easily.

## Reflection

The iPython shell kind of reads more like a IDE rather than a command line interface. So this makes it more useful than the simple Python shell because iPython is easier to read with more indentation and text differing in color. Also code is executed right away so you can see how the code is outputting.

An integer is a scalar object that represents negative and non-negative numbers. A bool is a scalar object that stores either a True or False value. A list is a non-scalar ordered sequence that is mutable meaning that elements within can be modified or deleted. A dictionary is a non-scalar data type that stores values and objects using key-value pairs.

Lists are like tuples however they are mutable meaning that the elements within the list can be modified or deleted. Elements within the list can also be rearranged and added. In terms of performance tuples are a bit more efficient because they are immutable and aren't meant to be modified.

If I was designing a language-learning application where users can input vocabulary words, definitions, and their category, I would use a dictionary data type. Simply because key-value pairs would work best as the "vocabulary word", "definition", and "category" keys would not change. Dictionaries are flexible because you could easily add or delete each word or even edit values.
