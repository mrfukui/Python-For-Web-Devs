Reflection


1. File storage is important while using Python in order for data to
be stored and not be erased as soon as the script is done running. If you didn't
store the local files the data would be deleted forever.

2. Pickles involve converting complex data into a packaged stream of bytes which in turn is written
into a binary file. This is helpful for the machine to store this complex
information. You would choose to use pickles when you wanted to store complex
data like dictionaries when using Python because this helps save and store
objects more easily.

3. To find out which directory you're currently in you
would want to use the os.getcwd() function. To change your current working
directory you would use the os.chdir() function.

4. To prevent an entire script from terminating due to an error you would want to write a try-except block.
Within the try block of code you try to execute the code you think might have an
error within it. Within the except block of code you let the user know there is
an error or better yet a specific error and how to move forward to resolve the
error. This gives you a chance to resolve different instances of errors while
still running the rest of your code block and not just terminating suddenly.

5.  I feel like things are going well and I'm intaking the material well. I'm proud
of commenting the code and making things as minimal and least redundant as
possible. I'm learning it is wise to print different messages within the code to
understand what happens when inputting data into the terminal.
