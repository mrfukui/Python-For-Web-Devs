1. Frontend web development is user oriented meaning the code is working on what
the user sees and interacts with such as the user interface. Backend development
involves databases or things that happen in the background that the user does
not see or interact with. If I was working on backend programming for a web
application, I would be working with maybe creating a database and organizing
how data will be stored and formatted or even retrieved. So I could be working
with MongoDB or FireBase to store information or data. 

2. Python is a little bit
more oriented towards back end development comparatively to JavaScript. Python
also has a little bit more out of the box ready web operations. Other than that
Python is also great because of its great readability and is a "high level
scripting language." 

3. I want to learn all the tools and capabilities of Python
so that I can use it creatively in other applications that I develop. I want to
get better at the the process as a whole of developing an application meaning
code commenting and just best coding practices. Hopefully in the future, I can
use Python to develop applications that help people access more well-being.
